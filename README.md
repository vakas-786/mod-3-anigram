    A vanilla javascript project that utilized a rails backend to generate random instagram like social media posts. The data was fetched using the ACNH API and seeded in the rails API that I built for this project. Users can leave a comment on each character, refresh to return to the first character "Cyrano", and listen to a song from the ANCH API.
